              Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM) is the first and only
              chartered and autonomous university funded by a city government.
              It was created by the Congress of the Philippines by virtue of
              Republic Act No. 4196 or “An Act Authorizing the City of Manila to
              Establish and Operate the University of City of Manila” on June
              19, 1965.
              <br /><br />

              The university first opened its gates on July 17, 1967 to 556
              first-year students at its campus in the historic Intramuros
              district, which served as the seat of power during the Spanish
              occupation. Currently, about 10,000 graduate and post-graduate
              students grace its halls to receive PLM’s quality education.
              <br /><br />

              PLM is the first local government-funded tertiary institution that
              offered tuition-free education. PLM also carries the distinction
              of being the first tertiary institution to have a Filipino
              official name, which is why people use “Pamantasan” to refer to
              PLM. The word pamantasan was derived from the Filipino term
              “pantas” or wise person.
